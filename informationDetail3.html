        Today’s new place is the board gaming café~!. <br/>
        This type of café is not seen often outside the borders of South Korea and Japan. At first, it was known as a date course where couples go a lot but nowadays, its pool of customers have widened and lots of people go whether they are a couple or not. Out of all the good board gaming places , hero board gaming café can be said to be one of the top notch.

          to the main one as its much bigger and comfy) . When entering the store, tell them your headcount and you’ll be shown to an open room according to it. Then, you’ll be given a menu that has the drinks and the types of board games along with a short introduction of each one. Order the drinks from the counter and you can pick the board games that you want from the shelf that’s right next to the counter. Really simple as that. After playing, clean up, and once you go to the counter and say your room number and the pay according to how much you played.

          It’s really relaxing as there are so many different types of board games to play. Some are very simple like stacking cards without making it fall ; some are hard as you would need to focus and think to win. Especially board games are not really common in other countries and there aren’t a lot of different types so it isn’t easy to play as much as you would do in Korea. Also, it can be played indoors in a comfy environment so that’s also another thing to consider.

          Some games to recommend for begineers are clue (mystery game, need to solve who killed the owner of the house) , davinchi code (guessing game where you have to guess each others hand ) , and Hali Gali ( really simple card taking game , may cause some noise).
