        How to use QR code check-in at high-risk areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting from June 10th, in order to enter high-risk areas( such as bars, entertainment<Br>
        facilities ,etc) , visitors must present their QR code Id using Naver or Kakaotalk.<Br>
        This is due to the sudden spread of the corona virus that started from the Itawon clubs.<Br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Qr code itself is easy to make as long as you have a smartphone with either the Naver app<Br> or the kakaotalk app. These two are the only apps that currently support the KI-Pass(the official<Br>
        name of the qr code) so you must have at least one of these apps with a working id to freely enter certain places in Korea. The codes itself is used to backtrack visitors that have entered places where those who have been infected with the corona virus have entered. Using the information, the South Korean government will try to prevent the spread of the virus to the best they can.
